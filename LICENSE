// ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

// MED derives from the Multiscale Electrophysiology Format (MEF), versions 1-3.
// Many people contributed to the MEF effort, but special mention is owed to
// Greg Worrell, Casey Stengel, Andy Gardner, Mark Bower, Vince Vasoli, Ben Brinkmann,
// Dan Crepeau, Jan Cimb√°lnik, Jon Lange, and Jon Halford for their contributions
// in design, coding, testing, implementation, and adoption.

// The encryption / decryption algorithm is the 128-bit AES standard ( http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf ).
// AES routines (128 bit only) are included in the library, with attribution, for convenience.

// The hash algorithm is the SHA-256 standard ( http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-4/fips-180-4.pdf ).
// Basic SHA-256 routines are included in the library, with attribution, for convenience.

// Strings are encoded in the Universal Character Set standard, ISO/IEC 10646:2012 otherwise known as UTF-8.
// ( http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c056921_ISO_IEC_10646_2012.zip )
// Basic UTF-8 manipulation routines are included in the library, with attribution, for convenience.

// Error detection is implemented with 32-bit cyclic redundancy checksums (CRCs).
// Basic CRC-32 manipulation routines are included in the library, with attribution, for convenience.


// USAGE:

// The library is optimized for 64-bit operating systems on 64-bit processors with 64-bit words and addressing.
// However, it can be used with in 32-bit contexts without modification at a performance cost.

// The library is written with tab width = indent width = 8 spaces and a monospaced font.
// Tabs are tabs characters, not spaces.
// Set your editor preferences to these for intended alignment.

// All functions, constants, macros, and data types defined in the library are tagged
// with the suffix "_m10" (for "MED 1.0"). This is to facilitate using multiple versions
// of the library in concert in the future; for example to write a MED 1.0 to MED 2.0 converter.
